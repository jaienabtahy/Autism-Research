# VR Learning Experience for Children with Autism
This is a portfolio project developed by [Jaien Abtahi] aimed at helping children with autism learn about day-to-day activities in a safe and controlled virtual reality (VR) environment.

## Overview
The project uses the Unity game engine to create a VR environment where children can learn how to perform daily activities, such as crossing the road safely or buying groceries. The project is specifically designed to cater to the needs of children with autism, who often have difficulty processing sensory information and learning in traditional classroom settings.

The VR environment includes interactive learning modules that teach children about various activities using visual and auditory cues. The project also includes a tracking system that monitors the child's progress and provides feedback on areas where they need improvement.

## Technologies Used
The project uses the following technologies:

- Unity game engine for VR environment creation
- C# programming language for game logic
- Oculus Rift or other VR headset for immersive experience
- 3D modeling software like Blender for creating virtual objects
## Features
The project includes the following features:

- VR environment for safe and controlled learning
- Interactive learning modules for day-to-day activities
- Tracking system for monitoring progress and providing feedback
- Customizable difficulty levels based on the child's needs
- Integration with VR headset and hand controllers for immersive experience
## Project Contributions
The following contributions were made to the project by [Jaien Abtahi]:

## Designed and developed the VR environment and learning modules using Unity and C#
- Created 3D models and animations for virtual objects using Blender
- Integrated tracking system for monitoring progress and providing feedback
- Customized difficulty levels based on the child's needs
- Conducted user testing and incorporated feedback to improve the user experience
## Credits
This project was developed by [Jaien Abtahi] with the guidance and support of [Dr. Mohammad Azhar] from [BMCC].

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of VR technology for education and learning, especially for children with special needs like autism. The project can be used as a foundation for further research and development in the field of VR-based education and training. With the rise of VR technology, this project showcases the potential to use it as a tool to create safe and controlled environments for learning and improving the lives of children with special needs.
